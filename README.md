# YGO_RESTfulAPI
# This will be a card collection tool. For the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG.
# This REST API was created due to a Pluralsight course:  https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/node-js-express-rest-web-services-update/table-of-contents
# We want to change this API from a Book Resource to the named card collection tool.
#
# 1. write docs about the API (how does it work, where do we GET data and where/how do we POST data, etc.)
# 2. write down the wanted changes and their necessary tasks
# 3. Used tech: JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB
# 4. following instructions..
